# Word-Puzzle-Game-Java-Project-
In my Object-oriented programming (OOP) course, I completed an  individual gaming project and that name was Word Puzzle Game. It was  a very interesting game because there were many English alphabetic  letters randomly and we had to do added these letters as a proper word  horizontally, vertically &amp; diagonally at a certain time. As a result, the  score would have increased. Otherwise, we would not able to go next  level. Its graphics design was amazing and could be played as a single player. This game was controlled by a mouse. In conclusion, this tremendous game was  created by Java Swing (JFrame) &amp; GUI application, etc. and the  platform was NetBeans IDE.
